                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Can I exchange or refund my ticket purchase?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        <strong>Refunds and Exchanges:</strong><br>
                        All sales are final. No refunds. Verify all information (title, date, time, seat selection, etc.) 
                        before purchasing tickets. Please Note: All ticket exchange requests must be made at least 24 hours 
                        before your scheduled performance. Requests made inside of 24 hours before or anytime after your scheduled 
                        performance will not be eligible for on-account credit, exchange, or refund.<br><br>

                        Subscribers may exchange tickets free of charge — one of the many subscriber benefits! Single-ticket holders 
                        may exchange for an additional fee ($5 per ticket). You may exchange tickets online, in person, or by phone 
                        for another performance within the same season, or receive on-account credit. There is an additional cost if
                        seating upgrades apply, and all exchange requests are subject to availability. You may also donate your 
                        tickets back to the Colorado Symphony and receive a donation receipt.<br><br>

                        <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> All on-account credit from the 2024/25 Season must be used during the 2024/25 Season, 
                        ending with season finale of Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto on May 30 – June 1, 2025. All unused on-account 
                        credit will be converted into a tax-deductible donation to the Colorado Symphony at the completion of the 
                        2024/25 Season.

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        <strong>On-Account Credit:</strong><br>
                        If you received on-account credit for a ticket return or exchange, you may use this credit through the conclusion of the concert season in which it was given. Credit from the 2024/25 Season may only be used for concerts at Boettcher Concert Hall through June 1, 2025. After this date, all unused on-account credit will be converted into a tax-deductible donation to the Colorado Symphony.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How much do Colorado Symphony tickets cost?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        <strong>Standard Ticketing:</strong> Prices vary based on the concert. The base ticket prices for most concerts are $15, $38, $68, $88, and $110. Family concerts are $10 for children and $27 for adults. Pricing for select Spotlight concerts are typically higher in price and vary by performance. Service fees and seat tax apply to all ticket purchases.
                        <br><br>
                        Ticket prices may increase, based on demand, as the concert date approaches. By purchasing early, you will get the best price and the best seat selection.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Discounted Ticketing:</strong> There are several ways to save money on ticket prices, and the quickest and easiest way is to sign up for eNotes — the Colorado Symphony weekly newsletter which gives you first access to what’s going on at the Symphony, including featured events and special discounts and promotions. Additionally, save on ticket prices by becoming a subscriber, or bring a group and receive a group discount. We also offer ticket discounts for children, students, teachers, and military personnel.

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Patrons are strongly encouraged to arrive early to factor in downtown traffic, parking, security, and getting to your seats before the performance begins. Be sure to check your email prior to heading to the venue; you will receive a reminder email containing important information related to your show several days before the performance.

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Contrary to what many people think, formal attire like tuxedos and evening gowns are not required. They aren’t even the norm! Most concert-goers wear business or cocktail attire, but you’ll see everything from jeans and t-shirts to suits and ties. The name of the game is comfort. First and foremost, we want you to enjoy the music!

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        For the comfort and enjoyment of our musicians and patrons, late seating is at the discretion of the House Manager and takes place during pauses in the program. The ushers will let you know when you may enter the hall. They may seat you in an area other than your ticketed seat so as to not disturb other patrons, and you may take your ticketed seat during intermission.
